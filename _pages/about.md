I am currently pursuing an Msc in Data Science & Machine Learning from UCL. I have had 3 years of prior experience working at Hero MotoCorp in the lab team for data analysis & acquisition to reduce vehicle emissions. I am passionate about all things to do with machine learning. Prior to working at Hero, I graduated from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore in 2018 studying Electrical & Electronics Engineering. 

The story so far

### Career

My undergraduate studies provided a solid foundation for growth in the field of ML. But it was not until I started my professional career that I began to realize the importance of data science & ML and how significant it has become as a skill-set in the industry. The Indian two-wheeler market was transitioning to new emission norms and with that came a whole host of new sensors on-board our vehicles. This meant that tons of data were now available to us, which we didnâ€™t have access to before. Mechanical problems in the vehicle could easily be recognized or predicted from patterns in the sensor data. Predictive Emission modeling, Objective scale rating evaluation, Fuel economy modeling are some of the projects that I had taken on when I started using tools in data science. In all of these cases, I had made my own dataset and attempted to make suitable models for each application. During my time at Hero, we were encouraged to learn as much as possible. This led me to swpending a lot of time on online learning resources like the stanford courses

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
